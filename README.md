## Branch Model

### `main`
- Stable, playable builds only
- Protected branch
- Pull requests into `main` must be approved and merged by the project maintainer (Code Owner)

### `dev`
- Shared integration branch
- All feature work is merged here after at least one approval from any contributor

### Feature Branches
Use short-lived branches for focused changes:
- `feature/...` — new gameplay, systems, mechanics
- `fix/...` — bug fixes
- `chore/...` — refactors, tooling, or non-gameplay changes

---

## Contributing

See the full contribution workflow in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Basic workflow

1. Update local `dev`:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   ```

2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/name
   ```

3. Make your changes in Godot

4. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

5. Push your branch and open a PR into `dev`:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/name
   ```

6. Get one approval  
   Once approved, the PR can be merged into `dev`.

7. Promotions from `dev` → `main`  
   These are handled only by the maintainer.
